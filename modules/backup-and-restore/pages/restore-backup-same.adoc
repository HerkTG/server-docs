:sectnums:
:description:

This page walks you through the process of restoring a database from a backup that was created from the same cluster.

Restoring a backup is an offline operation.
Your database will be down for a short period of time during database restore.

== Prerequisites
* You have access to the TigerGraph Linux user account on your cluster.
All commands must be run from the TigerGraph Linux user.
* You have access to a backup that was created from the same cluster.

== Procedure
To restore a backup, run the following command:

[.wrap,console]
----
$ gadmin backup restore <backup_tag>
----

For example, if you want to restore a backup with the tag `weekly-2022-08-31T004132`, run gadmin `backup restore weekly-2022-08-31T004132`.


The restore operation cannot be canceled once started.
