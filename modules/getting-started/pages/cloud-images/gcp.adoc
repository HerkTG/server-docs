. The default settings are fine for most users, but feel free to modify them. When ready, click on "Deploy".


NOTE: The instance type needs to have at least 4 CPUs and 16GB RAM for TigerGraph to work properly.

The "Allow TCP port 14240 traffic from the Internet" checkbox must be checked if you want to access GraphStudio (TigerGraph's visualization platform).
For more about GraphStudio, see the xref:gui:graphstudio:overview.adoc[GraphStudio UI Guide].

For information on how to set up authentication please see xref:user-access:index.adoc[User access management].

The "Allow TCP port 9000 traffic from the Internet" checkbox must be checked if you want to send RESTful requests to TigerGraph from outside the instance (this includes configuring the GSQL client on a remote machine). For more about the REST API, see the xref:API:index.adoc[REST API Reference].‌

For more about the TigerGraph Platform, see the xref:intro:index.adoc[TigerGraph Platform Overview].​
