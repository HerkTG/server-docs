. Select the instance type, security group settings, and other settings. The default settings are fine for most users, but feel free to modify them. Click "Launch" when finished.

*Notes:* +
The instance type needs to have at least 4 CPUs and 16GB RAM for TigerGraph to work properly.

The security group must allow inbound TCP traffic to port 14240 if you want to access GraphStudio (TigerGraph's visualization platform). For more about GraphStudio, see the xref:gui:graphstudio:overview.adoc[GraphStudio UI Guide].

The security group must allow inbound TCP traffic to port 9000 if you want to send RESTful requests to TigerGraph from outside the instance (this includes configuring the GSQL client on a remote machine). For more about the REST API, see the xref:API:intro.adoc[TigerGraph RESTful API User Guide].

For more about the TigerGraph Platform, see the xref:intro:introduction.adoc[TigerGraph Platform Overview].
