== My License key is not getting accepte

License keys are long — over 100 characters long. If you copy-and-paste the license key, be careful not to accidentally include an end-of-line character.

== SSH port 22 is blocked in my enviroment

You can use any other allowed port, you need to specify that during the installation phase (in case you are installing in interactive mode) or manually change the value `22` for the entry `SSHPort` in the `install_config.json` file

== Can we restrict the dynamic port range to a lower range?

It cannot be done from TigerGraph, it has to be done via firewall setting on the host machine. It’s important to know that applying such limitation *will not guarantee* TigerGraph to operate correctly (issues might not be instantly visible). Therefore it is NOT recommended at all restricting the dynamic port range
