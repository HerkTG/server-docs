= Single Sign-On
:experimental:
:sectnums:

The Single Sign-On (SSO) feature in TigerGraph enables you to use your organization's identity provider (IDP) to authenticate users to access TigerGraph GraphStudio and Admin Portal UI.

We have verified the following identity providers that support SAML 2.0 protocol:

* https://www.okta.com/[Okta]
* https://auth0.com/[Auth0]
* https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/[Azure Active Directory (Azure AD)]

For supporting additional IDPs, please inquire sales@tigergraph.com and submit a feature request.

In order to use Single Sign-On , you need to perform three steps :

. Configure your identity provider to create a TigerGraph application.
. Provide information from your identity provider to enable TigerGraph Single Sign-On.
. Create user groups with proxy rules to authorize Single Sign-On users.

:sectnums!:
== Before you begin
* Ensure that you can access GraphStudio UI through a web browser using the URL: \http://tigergraph-machine-honestname:14240
** If you enabled SSL connection, change `http` to `https`.
If you changed the Nginx port of the TigerGraph system, replace 14240 with the port you have set.
* Ensure that you have xref:enabling-user-authentication.adoc#_enable_gsql_authentication[enabled GSQL authentication by changing the password of the default user].
If you don't enable GSQL authentication, SSO configuration will not work and any user will be logged in automatically.

== Configure Identity Provider
:sectnums!:

Below are detailed instructions for identity providers that we have verified.
Please consult your IT or security department for how to configure the identity provider for your organization if it is not listed here.

After you finish configuring your identity provider, you will get the following:

* An Identity Provider Single Sign-On URL
* An Identity Provider Entity ID
* an X.509 certificate file `idp.cert`. You need these 3 things to configure TigerGraph next.

=== Okta

https://developer.okta.com/docs/guides/build-sso-integration/saml2/create-your-app/[Create an Application Integration in Okta] for your TigerGraph application.
Below are the Assertion Consumer Service URL / Single sign on URL , and SP Entity ID required for this process:

* Assertion Consumer Service URL/Single sign on URL:
[literal]
http://<tigergraph-machine-hostname>:14240/api/auth/saml/acs
* SP Entity ID URL:
[literal]
http://<tigergraph-machine-hostname>:14240/gsqlserver/gsql/saml/meta


=== Auth0

. https://auth0.com/docs/get-started/create-apps/single-page-web-apps[Register TigerGraph as a Single-Page web application in Auth0].
. https://auth0.com/docs/configure/saml-configuration/configure-auth0-saml-identity-provider#configure-saml-sso-in-auth0[Configure Auth0 as SAML Identity provider].
You will need to enter the following information when following Auth0's guide:
* Application Callback URL:
[literal]
http://<tigergraph-machine-hostname>:14240/api/auth/saml/acs`
* When downloading the certificate from Auth0, choose *`.cer`* format instead of `.pem` format.

=== Azure AD

. Log into https://aad.portal.azure.com/[Azure Active Directory Admin Center] as an Admin user.
In the left menu, select menu:Enterprise applications[New Application].
+
image::azure-new-application.png[]
. In the top left corner, click btn:[Create your own application].
+
image::azure-create-app.png[]
+
In the form that appears on the right side of the page, fill in the name of your application and choose btn:[Integrate any other application you don't find in the gallery (Non-gallery)].
This creates the application and takes you to the application page
. On the left pane of the application page, click btn:[Single sign-on] and choose btn:[SAML].
+
image::azure-saml.png[]
This takes you to a page titled "Set up single sign-on with SAML".
. Fill in *Identifier (Entity ID)* and *Reply URL* with the information below.
Replace `<tigergraph-machine-hostname>` with the host name of your TigerGraph instance:
* Identifier (Entity ID): `\https://<tigergraph-machine-hostname>:14240/gsqlserver/gsql/saml/meta`
* Reply URL: `\https://<tigergraph-machine-hostname>:14240/api/auth/saml/acs`
. After filling in the Entity ID and Reply URL, click btn:[Edit] for *SAML Signing Certificate*, and choose btn:[Sign SAML Assertion and Response].
Click btn:[Save] and download certificate (base64).
* We recommend signing both assertion and response for maximum security.
However, you may choose to only sign one of them, but you need to match this setting with when you enable SSO on TigerGraph.
. Under "Set up <Application name>", Azure AD provides a login URL, an Azure AD identifier, and a logout URL.
These items are used in the next steps to configure single sign-on in TigerGraph.

== Enable Single Sign-On in TigerGraph

Having configured the identity provider and obtained the identity provider's SSO URL, entity ID and certificate, the next step is to provide the information to TigerGraph to enable single sign-on.

=== Navigate to SSO page
From GraphStudio home page, click btn:[Admin Portal] in the upper right corner.
In the left pane, click menu:Management[Security > SSO].
At the top of the SSO page, click the toggle to btn:[Enable SAML-based SSO].

=== Update service provider URL
The service provider (in this case - TigerGraph) URL is the same URL that you use to access GraphStudio.

=== Prepare service provider certificate and private key
Under SAML, the service provider can optionally sign the SAML requests made to the identity provider.
This step configures the certificate and private key used for the signature.

According to the SAML standard trust model, a self-signed certificate is acceptable.
This is different from configuring an SSL connection, where a CA-authorized certificate is considered mandatory if the system goes to production.

You can generate a self-signed private key and x-509 certificate from GraphStudio.
Click the button next to the Service Provider's private key field: menu:Upload file[Self Signed], and fill in your information to generate a self-signed private key and x-509 certificate.

=== Provide IDP certificate, entity ID, and URLs
Upload the certificate you downloaded from the identity provider in the previous step, and provide the identity provider's entity ID and single sign-on URL in the corresponding fields.


=== Configure security options
At the bottom of the SSO page are a list of security options you can configure for SSO:

* Sign authentication requests before sending to Identity Provider
* Require Identity Provider to sign link:https://www.samltool.com/generic_sso_res.php[responses]
* Require Identity Provider to sign link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SAML_2.0#SAML_2.0_assertions[assertions]
* Require Identity Provider to sign link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SAML_metadata[metadata]
* link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_Signature_Algorithm[Signature algorithm]
* link:http://docs.oasis-open.org/security/saml/v2.0/saml-authn-context-2.0-os.pdf[Authentication context]
** An attribute that defines how a user should log in.
** Example value: `urn:oasis:names:tc:SAML:2.0:ac:classes:Password`

It is recommended that you enable as many of the options as possible for maximum security.
However, some identity providers do not support enabling certain options at the same time.
Refer to your identity provider's documentation to determine which options to use.



=== Command-line options
Besides providing the SSO information in the UI, you also have the option of providing the information using `gadmin config` through the command-line.

Below is the list of parameters you need to configure.
You can run xref:system-management:management-with-gadmin.adoc#_gadmin_config_set[`gadmin config set`] to configure their value non-interactively, or run `gadmin confing entry Security.SSO.SAML` to configure their values interactively in the terminal.

== Create user groups with proxy rules to authorize Single Sign-On users

In order to authorize Single Sign-On users, you need create user groups with proxy rules and grant roles on graphs for the user groups.
Proxy rules assign users who log in through SSO into proxy groups based on the attributes of the user from the identity provider's response.

=== Required privilege

* `WRITE_PROXYGROUP` for creating proxy groups.
* `WRITE_ROLE` for granting roles to users

==== Create proxy groups in Admin Portal

You can create proxy groups in Admin Portal:

. From Admin Portal, navigate to menu:Management[Users > Proxy Group].
. Click btn:[Add Group], and give the group a name.
. Provide the attribute equation for the proxy group.
If a user's specified attribute matches the value in the equation, they will be assigned to this proxy group.

After creating the proxy group, you can start granting roles to the proxy group.
All users matching the proxy rule will be granted all the privileges of that role.
To learn how to grant roles, see xref:role-management.adoc[].

==== Create proxy groups in GSQL shell
You can create proxy groups with GSQL commands.

===== Single User Proxy

For example, if you want to create a user group `SuperUserGroup` that contains the user with nameid `admin@your.company.com` only, and grant `superuser` role to that user, you can do so with the following command:

[.wrap,gsql]
----
GSQL > CREATE GROUP SuperUserGroup PROXY "nameid=admin@your.company.com"
GSQL > GRANT ROLE superuser TO SuperUserGroup
Role "superuser" is successfully granted to user(s): SuperUserGroup
----

===== User Group Proxy

Suppose you want to create a user group `HrDepartment` which corresponds to the identity provider Single Sign-On users having the group attribute value `hr-department`, and want to grant the queryreader role to that group on the graph HrGraph:

[.wrap,gsql]
----
GSQL > CREATE GROUP HrDepartment PROXY "group=hr-department"
GSQL > GRANT ROLE queryreader ON GRAPH HrGraph TO HrDepartment
Role "queryreader" is successfully granted to user(s): HrDepartment
----

== Test Single Sign-On

To test if single sign-on is working, visit the GraphStudio UI in your browser.
You should see a btn:[Login with SSO] button:

image::11.25.png[]

Click the button to navigate to your identity provider's login portal:

* If you are already logged in with your identity provider, you will be redirected back to GraphStudio immediately.
After about 10 seconds, the verification should finish, and you are authorized to use GraphStudio.
* If you aren't logged in at your identity provider, you will need to log in.

After logging in successfully, you will see your Single Sign-On username when you click the User icon  image:11.1 (1).png[,35]  at the upper right of the GraphStudio UI.

:sectnums!:
== Common errors

Below are a few common SSO errors and how to resolve them.

=== User has no access to any graph
* If you return to the login page and see the error message saying you do not have access to any graph, check your user group proxy rules, and roles you have granted to the groups.

=== "Login failed. Please contact system admin."

* If your Single Sign-On fails with the above error message, it usually means the configuration are inconsistent between TigerGraph and your identity provider.


You can check your GSQL log to investigate.
First, find your GSQL log file with the following:

[source,console]
----
$ gadmin log gsql
GSQL   : /home/tigergraph/tigergraph/log/gsql/log.INFO
----

Then, grep the SAML authentication-related logs:

[source,console]
----
cat /home/tigergraph/tigergraph/log/gsql/log.INFO | grep SAMLAuth
----

Focus on the latest errors.
Usually the text is self-descriptive.
Follow the error message and try to fix TigerGraph or your identity provider's configuration.

If the problem persists or if you encounter any errors that are not clear, please contact link:mailto:support@tigergraph.com[support@tigergraph.com].
