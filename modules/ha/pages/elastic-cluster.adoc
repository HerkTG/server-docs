= Compute-on-demand Elastic Cluster
:description: Overview of TigerGraph's compute-on-demand ER cluster.

TigerGraph allows you to spin up an Elastic Read-only (ER) cluster from your primary cluster to handle compute-intensive online analytical processing (OLAP) queries on demand.
Operations on the ER cluster do not interfere with the primary cluster in any way.

NOTE: This feature is currently in alpha.
If you want to set up elastic clusters for your production environment, contact mailto:support@tigergraph.com[].

The elasticity afforded by on-demand ER clusters can provide the following benefits:

* Better availability.
Diverting memory-intensive and time-consuming OLAP queries to an isolated ER cluster allows your primary cluster to have better availability for other workloads.
* Better cost management.
Provisioning dedicated machines to process OLAP can prove quite expensive.
When the queries are not running, the excess hardware sits idle, which is a waste of resources.
The elasticity of ER clusters make sure that you are only paying for computing power you need when you need it.


== Architecture
The ER cluster shares storage with the primary cluster.
When the ER cluster is set up, it reads from the shared storage to retrieve all data from the primary cluster.
After setup, it no longer receives updates from the primary cluster.

The ER clusters are able to process memory-intensive OLAP queries in an isolated environment with no impact to the primary cluster.
After the queries finish, the ER cluster should be shut down.
The next time when there is a demand for a memory-intensive OLAP query, you can set up a new ER cluster to meet the demand.

== Use cases
If your workload involves online analytical processing (OLAP) queries that access large amounts of data and are very time-consuming, you can benefit from user ER clusters for your OLAP queries.
