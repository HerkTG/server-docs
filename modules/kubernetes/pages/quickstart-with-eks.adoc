== Before you begin

* Provision Kubernetes cluster on EKS with nodes that meet the xref:installation:hw-and-sw-requirements.adoc[hardware and software requirements] to run TigerGraph.
* https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/[Install `kubectl` on your machine,] and make sure your local `kubectl` version is within one minor version's difference from the `kubectl` version on your cluster.
