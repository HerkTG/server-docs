TigerGraph Server {page-component-version}.0 was released on February 28th, 2023.

== New features

The following is a list of new features and improvements:

=== TigerGraph Server
* For the xref:tigergraph-server:data-loading:data-streaming-connector/index.adoc[]:
** Added support for xref:tigergraph-server:data-loading:data-streaming-connector/index.adoc#_define_the_parameters[Parquet file format].
** Documented additional S3 authentication configuration parameters.
** Added auto-detection of new files when in Stream mode.
* Added new xref:tigergraph-server:API:built-in-endpoints.adoc[REST Endpoints]:
** `/library` is a set of endpoints for showing and running template queries.
** `/showdelayedlistall` shows how many queries are in the delayed queue.
* Added a new command for `gadmin backup` to xref:backup-and-restore:backup-cluster.adoc#back-up-a-database-cluster[control the number of backups]
* Expanded the list of xref:tigergraph-server:reference:error-codes.adoc[system response codes] to include one for an invalid vertex ID.
* Improved the backend security infrastructure for the Kafka loader.

=== TigerGraph Insights

* Added support for multi-user editing and sharing of the same xref:insights:intro:applications.adoc[].
* Added the ability for users to xref:insights:widgets:index.adoc#_save_a_widget[save a widget] independently instead of tying it to an application.
* Added a mini-map to the xref:insights:widgets:graph-widget.adoc[] for easier navigation.

=== GSQL Language

* Moved xref:tigergraph-server:data-loading:data-streaming-connector/index.adoc[data connector] setup from `gadmin` to GSQL. Streamlined the user experience for creating loading jobs for data stored in AWS, GCP, and Azure, directly integrating the data streaming connector with GSQL and reducing the steps needed to load data.
** Introduced a new `STREAM` data loading type that simplifies the xref:tigergraph-server:data-loading:index.adoc[data loading process] from remote data storage.
** Data loading with a `STREAM` connector now automatically adds new files from remote storage in near-real time.
** Significantly improved CPU usage after connector finishes data loading.
* Added a new set of xref:gsql-ref:ddl-and-loading:functions/token/index.adoc[token functions for string manipulation].
* `to_string()` now supports all primitive and primitiveAccum data types.
* Enhanced multi-edge capability by adding support for batch deletion of multiedges, both with GSQL commands and as a xref:tigergraph-server:API:built-in-endpoints.adoc#delete-an-edge-by-source-target-edge-type-and-discriminator[REST endpoint].
* Queries can now be drafted and saved as xref:gsql-ref:querying:query-operations.adoc[draft queries] before they are able to be installed as functional queries.
* Improved and standardized `SHOW PACKAGE` so it follows the same behavior as other `SHOW` catalog commands.


=== JDBC Spark Connector

* Added support for loading job monitoring on xref:data-loading:spark-connection-via-jdbc-driver.adoc[JDBC Spark connector] loading jobs.
* Added the ability to assign a specific job ID to a JDBC loading job.
* Added error limiting parameters to JDBC loading jobs to cancel loading automatically when errors surpass a certain threshold.

=== Kubernetes Operator

* Expanded the functionality of the xref:kubernetes:k8s-operator/index.adoc[].
The Operator is now the preferred way for users to perform cluster operations with Kubernetes.
* Added xref:kubernetes:k8s-operator/backup-and-restore.adoc[], version upgrade, and resource update functionality.

=== Admin Portal

* Reworked the xref:gui:admin-portal:dashboard.adoc[] to show the relationship hierarchy and status of all TigerGraph components for at-a-glance understanding of the TigerGraph system.

=== GDS Library and ML Workbench
* Added NodePiece scalable node embedding algorithm.
* Added xref:1.3@pytigergraph:intro:index.adoc[pyTigerGraph] support for asynchronous queries (i.e., running in the background).

=== Security

* Updated our response to xref:master@home::cve-2022-30331.adoc[CVE-2022-30331].

== Fixed issues

* Improved stability and security across all components.
* Fixed an issue with the GSQL `SELECT * FROM` and `PRINT` functions converting some special characters from UTF-8 to UTF-16.
Previously affected character sets included the Unicode range `0080` to `00A0` and `2000` to `2100` (Near Eastern scripts and some special typographical marks).
* The `SELECT * FROM` and `PRINT` functions no longer convert large integers to strings before printing, resulting in quotation marks printed along with the number.
* Improved backend infrastructure for Kafka security.
* xref:cluster-resizing:expand-a-cluster.adoc[] no longer requires a graph schema.
* Extended the timeout length for queries in the wait queue so that they are not timed out early.

== Deprecations
* Kubernetes classic  mode (non-operator) is deprecated, as of v3.9.
* The `WRITE_DATA` RBAC privilege is deprecated, as of v3.7.

== Known issues

* During peak system load, loading jobs may sometimes display an inaccurate loading status. This issue can be remediated by continuing to run `SHOW LOADING STATUS` periodically to display the up-to-date status.
* When managing many loading jobs, pausing a data loading job may result in longer-than-usual response time.
* Schema change jobs may fail if the server is experiencing a heavy workload. To remedy this, avoid applying schema changes during peak load times.
* User-defined Types (UDT) do not work if exceeding string size limit. Avoid using UDT for variable length strings that cannot be limited by size.
* Unable to handle the tab character `\t` properly in AVRO or Parquet file loading. It will be loaded as `\\t`.
