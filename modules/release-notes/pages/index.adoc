:fn-preview: footnote:preview[Features in the preview stage should not be used for production purposes. General Availability (GA) versions of the feature will be available in a later release.]

TigerGraph Server {page-component-version}.0 was released on Nov 15th, 2022.

== New Features

The following is a list of new features and improvements:

=== Developer tools - GraphStudio

* Introduced xref:insights:intro:index.adoc[TigerGraph Insights], a no-code graph analyzer for making interactive visual dashboards.
* Added support for multiple edge instances between two vertices in GraphStudio.
* Reworked the xref:gui:graphstudio:map-data-to-graph.adoc[data loading workflow] for adding data sources to a graph.
* Added the ability to load data to a graph from Azure Blob Storage.

=== Developer tools - Graph Data Science Algorithm Library

* Added xref:1.0@graph-ml:using-an-algorithm:index.adoc[Packaged Template Queries] as a significantly more streamlined way for developers to instantly install a set of data science algorithms for use on any graph.
* Added the `CALL` function to call a pre-installed template query rather than having to copy it and install it manually.
* Updated parameter names to be consistently more readable across all algorithms
* Introduced versioning of the algorithm library for the first time

=== Manageability
* Added the ability to xref:system-management:workload-management.adoc#_limit_number_of_concurrent_queries[limit the number of concurrent built-in heavy queries] as well as xref:system-management:workload-management.adoc#_limit_number_of_concurrent_queries[concurrent queries].
* Added the functionality to xref:system-management:memory-management.adoc#_limit_query_memory_usage[restrict the amount of memory a query is allowed to use].

=== Query Language
* Added the xref:gsql-ref:ddl-and-loading:defining-a-graph-schema.adoc#_discriminator[`DISCRIMINATOR` keyword] to enable defining edge types that allow multiple edge instances between two vertices.

=== Performance
* Introduced the xref:gsql-ref:querying:query-optimizer/index.adoc[query optimizer], which performs cost-based optimization on queries based on pre-computed statistics.

=== Data API Service
* Added support for endpoints that xref:API:upsert-rest.adoc[insert], xref:tigergraph-server:API:built-in-endpoints.adoc#_retrieve_edge_by_source_target_edge_type_and_discriminator[retrieve], and xref:tigergraph-server:API:built-in-endpoints.adoc#_delete_an_edge_by_source_target_edge_type_and_discriminator[delete edge instances] to handle situations where there are multiple instances of an edge type between two vertices.
* Added xref:API:built-in-endpoints.adoc#_list_all_running_queries[the `POST /showprocessall`] endpoint, which lists all currently running queries on a node.


=== Security
* xref:gsql-ref:querying:func/query-user-defined-functions.adoc[Strengthened the security requirements] for the management of user-defined functions (UDF).
* Sensitive information such as ACL passwords are now masked when entering passwords interactively.
* All personally identifiable information in data source configuration when using the Kafka loader or Data Streaming Connector are now masked.
* Added xref:security:login-protection.adoc[login protection] and the ability for administrators to xref:security:password-policy.adoc[enable a password policy].


=== Stability



=== Ecosystem integration
* Added the ability to xref:data-loading:data-streaming-connector/big-query.adoc[query and stream data from Google Big Query] to Data Streaming Connector.
* Added the ability to configure how much memory Data Streaming Connectors are allowed to use through the `KafkaConnect.MaxMemorySizeMB` parameter.
* Added the ability to shrink or expand a cluster using the `kubectl tg update` command in Kubernetes.

=== Observability
* Added xref:API:built-in-endpoints.adoc#_monitor_system_metrics_openmetrics[the `/metrics` endpoint] to report system metrics in OpenMetrics format.
* Added the ability to monitor queries through AdminPortal and view query performance over time.
* Added the capability for the Graph Processing Engine (GPE) to xref:system-management:memory-management.adoc#_monitor_memory_usage[log the highest memory usage of a query during its execution].

== Release notes for previous versions
* xref:3.7@tigergraph-server:release-notes:index.adoc[Release notes - TigerGraph 3.7]
* xref:3.6@tigergraph-server:release-notes:index.adoc[Release notes - TigerGraph 3.6]
* xref:3.5@tigergraph-server:release-notes:index.adoc[Release notes - TigerGraph 3.5]
* xref:3.4@tigergraph-server:release-notes:release-notes.adoc[Release notes - TigerGraph 3.4]
* xref:3.3@tigergraph-server:release-notes:release-notes.adoc[Release notes - TigerGraph 3.3]
* xref:3.2@tigergraph-server:release-notes:release-notes.adoc[Release notes - TigerGraph 3.2]

== Compatibility with TigerGraph 3.4
* A single `POST-ACCUM` clause can no longer reference more than one vertex alias in Syntax V1.
* `GET /requesttoken` endpoint is dropped.
Please use `POST /requesttoken` to request authentication tokens instead.
** Using request body to store credentials is more secure than using query string.
If you have a create a token request that puts the credentials in the query string, all you need to do is use the `POST` endpoint and move your credentials to the request body. 
* `GET /gsqlserver/gsql/queryinfo` endpoint on port 14240 now returns the query input parameters in the same order as they are in the query instead of an unordered list.
* Deploying TigerGraph in Kubernetes now requires more service account permissions than previous versions.
