TigerGraph Server {page-component-version}.0 was released on February 28th, 2023

== New Features

The following is a list of new features and improvements:

=== TigerGraph Server

* Added new xref:tigergraph-server:API:built-in-endpoints.adoc[REST Endpoints]:
** `/library` is a set of endpoints for showing and running template queries.
** `/showdelayedlistall` shows how many queries are in the delayed queue.
* Added a new command for `gadmin backup` to xref:backup-and-restore:backup-cluster.adoc#back-up-a-database-cluster[control the number of backups]
* Expanded the list of xref:tigergraph-server:reference:error-codes.adoc[system response codes] to include one for an invalid vertex ID.
* Improved the backend security infrastructure for the Kafka loader.

=== TigerGraph Insights

* Added support for multi-user editing of the same application.
* Added the ability for users to save widgets independently instead of tying them to an application.
* Added a mini-map to the xref:insights:widgets:graph-widget.adoc[] for easier navigation.

=== GSQL Language

* Added a new set of xref:3.8@gsql-ref:ddl-and-loading:functions/token/index.adoc[token functions for string manipulation].
* `to_string()` now supports all primitive and primitiveAccum data types.
* Added a xref:tigergraph-server:API:built-in-endpoints.adoc#delete-an-edge-by-source-target-edge-type-and-discriminator[REST endpoint] and expanded the DELETE command to support batch delete for multiple edges.
* Queries can now be drafted and saved as xref:gsql-ref:querying:query-operations.adoc[draft queries] before they are able to be installed as functional queries.
* Streamlined the user experience for creating loading jobs for data stored in AWS, GCP, and Azure, directly integrating the data streaming connector with GSQL and reducing the steps needed to load data.
** Introduced a new `STREAM` data loading type that simplifies the xref:tigergraph-server:data-loading:index.adoc[data loading process] from remote data storage.
** Data loading with a `STREAM` connector now automatically adds new files from remote storage in near-real time.
** Significantly improved CPU usage after connector finishes data loading.
* Added support for loading job monitoring on xref:data-loading:spark-connection-via-jdbc-driver.adoc[JDBC Spark connector] loading jobs

=== Kubernetes Operator

* Expanded the functionality of the xref:kubernetes:k8s-operator/index.adoc[].
The Operator is now the preferred way for users to perform cluster operations with Kubernetes.
* Added backup and restore, version upgrade, and resource update functionality.

=== Admin Portal

* Reworked the xref:gui:admin-portal:dashboard.adoc[] to show the relationship hierarchy and status of all TigerGraph components for at-a-glance understanding of the TigerGraph system.

== Fixed Issues

* Improved stability and security across all components.
* Fixed an issue with the GSQL `SELECT * FROM` and `PRINT` functions converting some special characters from UTF-8 to UTF-16.
Previously affected character sets included the Unicode range `0080` to `00A0` and `2000` to `2100` (Near Eastern scripts and some special typographical marks).
* The `SELECT * FROM` and `PRINT` functions no longer convert large integers to strings before printing, resulting in quotation marks printed along with the number.
* Improved backend infrastructure for Kafka security
* xref:cluster-resizing:expand-a-cluster.adoc[] no longer requires a graph schema.
* Extended the timeout length for queries in the wait queue so that they are not timed out early.


== Release notes for previous versions
* xref:3.8@tigergraph-server:release-notes:index.adoc[Release notes - TigerGraph 3.8]
* xref:3.7@tigergraph-server:release-notes:index.adoc[Release notes - TigerGraph 3.7]
* xref:3.6@tigergraph-server:release-notes:index.adoc[Release notes - TigerGraph 3.6]
* xref:3.5@tigergraph-server:release-notes:index.adoc[Release notes - TigerGraph 3.5]
* xref:3.4@tigergraph-server:release-notes:release-notes.adoc[Release notes - TigerGraph 3.4]
* xref:3.3@tigergraph-server:release-notes:release-notes.adoc[Release notes - TigerGraph 3.3]
* xref:3.2@tigergraph-server:release-notes:release-notes.adoc[Release notes - TigerGraph 3.2]

== Compatibility with TigerGraph 3.4
* A single `POST-ACCUM` clause can no longer reference more than one vertex alias in Syntax V1.
* `GET /requesttoken` endpoint is dropped.
Please use `POST /requesttoken` to request authentication tokens instead.
** Using request body to store credentials is more secure than using query string.
If you have a create a token request that puts the credentials in the query string, all you need to do is use the `POST` endpoint and move your credentials to the request body. 
* `GET /gsqlserver/gsql/queryinfo` endpoint on port 14240 now returns the query input parameters in the same order as they are in the query instead of an unordered list.
* Deploying TigerGraph in Kubernetes now requires more service account permissions than previous versions.
