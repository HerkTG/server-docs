=== Create connector
Once you have prepared the configuration file, run command `gadmin connector create` and specify the configuration file to create the connector:

  gadmin connector create --c <config_file>

The connectors start streaming from the data source immediately after creation if the configurations are valid.
You can run `gadmin connector status` to verify the status of the connectors.
If the configurations are valid, the connectors should be in `RUNNING` status.

Data streamed from the source stays in TigerGraph's internal Kafka topics until they are ingested by a loading job.
