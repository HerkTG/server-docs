=== Create data source
Now that the connector has started loading data into TigerGraph's internal Kafka cluster, you can create a data source and point it to the Kafka cluster:

. Create a data source configuration file.
The broker's IP and hostname should be `localhost:30002`, which points to the port for TigerGraph's internal Kafka cluster.
In the `kafka.config` field, set `group.id` to `tigergraph`:
+
[.wrap,json]

    {
        "broker":"localhost:30002",
        "kafka_config":
            {
                "group.id": "tigergraph"
            }
    }
----
. Run `CREATE DATA SOURCE` to create the data source:
