# Review

You have learned a lot in GSQL 101!

With just the knowledge from GSQL 101 and a little practice, you should be able to do the following:

* Create a graph schema containing multiple vertex types and edge types.
* Define a loading job that takes one or more CSV files and maps the data directly to the vertices and edges of your graph.
* Write and run simple parameterized queries which start at one vertex and then traverse one or more hops to generate a final vertex set. Make a simple additive computation and return the results.

* To learn to do the same types of operations using the GraphStudio Visual SDK and UI, see the [TigerGraph GraphStudio UI Guide](../../ui/graphstudio/).
* Continue learning [Accumulators](../accumulators-tutorial.md) and [Pattern Matching](../gsql-102/).
*  To see more GSQL examples, see [IS](https://github.com/tigergraph/ecosys/tree/ldbc/ldbc_benchmark/tigergraph/queries/interactive_short),  [IC](https://github.com/tigergraph/ecosys/tree/ldbc/ldbc_benchmark/tigergraph/queries/interactive_complex), and [BI](https://github.com/tigergraph/ecosys/tree/ldbc/ldbc_benchmark/tigergraph/queries/business_intelligence) workloads based on [LDBC](http://ldbc.github.io/ldbc_snb_docs/ldbc-snb-specification.pdf) benchmark [schema](https://github.com/tigergraph/ecosys/blob/ldbc/ldbc_benchmark/tigergraph/load_scripts/setup_schema.gsql), and [ GSQL Demo Examples .](../gsql-examples/)
